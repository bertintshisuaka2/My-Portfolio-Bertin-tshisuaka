  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Modern Industrial
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Honest**: Exposing the structure, using high contrast, and avoiding unnecessary decoration.
  2. **Bold Hierarchy**: Typography is the primary visual element, with massive headings and clear, structured data.
  3. **Functional Aesthetics**: Every element has a clear purpose; borders are thick, buttons are rectangular and distinct.
  4. **Information Density**: Designed to handle the large number of projects (34) without feeling cluttered, using grid systems effectively.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Monochrome Base**: Stark black and white for maximum contrast and readability.
  - **Electric Accents**: Using a single, vibrant accent color (e.g., Electric Blue or Neon Lime) to highlight interactive elements and key data points. This creates a sense of digital precision and energy.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict, visible grid system that organizes the projects into a cohesive structure.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Breaking the grid occasionally with large, featured project cards to create visual interest.
  - **Sidebar Navigation**: A persistent, sticky sidebar for easy filtering and navigation across the many categories.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: All containers and cards have distinct, thick borders (2px-3px).
  - **Monospace Typography**: Using a high-quality monospace font for metadata (tags, dates, tech stack) to reinforce the "developer" aesthetic.
  - **Brutal Shadows**: Hard, non-blurred shadows for buttons and cards to give them a tactile, "sticker-like" feel.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Immediate Feedback**: Hover states are instant and high-contrast (e.g., background color swap).
  - **Mechanical Feel**: Transitions are snappy and linear, avoiding overly smooth or "bouncy" animations.

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitch effects on hover for project titles.
  - **Reveal Animations**: Content loads with a quick, staggered slide-up or reveal effect.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Chakra Petch' – bold, geometric, and slightly futuristic.
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Public Sans' – clean and neutral for readability.
  - **Code/Meta**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Fira Code' – for technical details.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Ethereal Tech
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Translucency & Depth**: Using frosted glass effects to create layers and depth, making the interface feel light and airy.
  2. **Soft Gradients**: Backgrounds feature subtle, moving gradients that provide a dynamic and immersive atmosphere.
  3. **Floating Elements**: Cards and content appear to float above the background, enhanced by soft, diffuse shadows.
  4. **Focus on Content**: The interface recedes to let the project content (images and descriptions) shine.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Pastel & Neon Blend**: A background of deep, dark blues or purples with floating orbs of cyan, magenta, and violet.
  - **Light Text**: White text with varying opacities to create hierarchy without harsh contrast.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Masonry Grid**: A fluid, masonry-style layout for the project cards to accommodate varying content lengths naturally.
  - **Centralized Focus**: A strong central column for content, with navigation floating or tucked away in a hamburger menu or minimal top bar.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Glass Cards**: Project cards have a semi-transparent background with a backdrop blur.
  - **Glowing Borders**: Subtle, gradient borders that glow on hover.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Generous border radius (xl or 2xl) for a friendly, organic feel.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluidity**: Interactions are smooth and continuous, like moving through water.
  - **Parallax**: Subtle parallax effects on background elements as the user scrolls.

  **Animation**:
  - **Float Animations**: Background elements gently float and pulse.
  - **Smooth Fade-ins**: Content fades in with a soft blur effect.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Outfit' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' – geometric but friendly.
  - **Body**: 'Quicksand' or 'Nunito' – rounded and approachable.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Systems**: A rigorous adherence to a mathematical grid for alignment and organization.
  2. **Asymmetry**: Using asymmetric layouts to create dynamic and interesting compositions.
  3. **Sans-Serif Typography**: Reliance on clean, objective sans-serif typefaces.
  4. **Clarity & Readability**: The primary goal is the clear communication of information.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Neutral Canvas**: White or very light gray background to serve as a neutral canvas.
  - **Primary Colors**: Using bold, primary colors (Red, Blue, Yellow) sparingly for emphasis and categorization.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Split Screen**: A split-screen layout for featured projects, with image on one side and text on the other.
  - **List Views**: Clean, typographic list views for the project index, expandable on click.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Large Typography**: Headlines are massive and set in a tight leading.
  - **Negative Space**: Generous use of white space to let the content breathe.
  - **Minimalist Icons**: Simple, geometric icons used only when necessary.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Precise**: Interactions are crisp and deliberate.
  - **Information Reveal**: Progressive disclosure of details to keep the initial view clean.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide Transitions**: Content slides in from the sides or bottom with precision.
  - **Typography Scaling**: Headlines might scale down slightly on scroll to make room for content.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Helvetica Now' or 'Neue Haas Grotesk' (or 'Inter' as a free alternative) – the gold standard of Swiss typography.
  - **Body**: 'Roboto' or 'Arial' – neutral and legible.
